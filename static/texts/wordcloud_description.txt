I used natural language processing (NLP) to create a list of words/phrases for the wordcloud. I did this by using Python and the NLP library 'spacy' to use their pre-trained model to predict the entities from the descriptions of the courses that I have completed, and filtered out the entities with uninteresting labels. The Python library 'WordCloud' was then used to produce the graphic. The code can be found on my GitHub.
